# ✅ Health Connect Integration Checklist for S.O.M.E fitness method

## 🔧 Setup

- [x] Add Health Connect dependency:
  ```groovy
  implementation "androidx.health.connect:connect-client:1.1.0-rc03"
  ```
- [x] Check if Health Connect is available via `HealthConnectClient.sdkStatus`
- [x] Create `HealthConnectClient` instance:
  ```kotlin
  val healthConnectClient = HealthConnectClient.getOrCreate(context)
  ```

---

## 🔐 Permissions

- [x] Declare permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
  ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.health.READ" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.health.WRITE" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.health.READ_HEALTH_DATA_HISTORY" />
  ```
- [x] Request runtime permissions using Health Connect API:
  ```kotlin
  val permissions = setOf(
      Permission.createReadPermission(Steps::class),
      Permission.createWritePermission(Steps::class),
      Permission.createReadPermission(SleepSession::class),
      Permission.createReadPermission(HeartRate::class)
  )
  ```
- [x] Handle permission result and revocation with user feedback

---

## 🔄 Data Access & Sync

- [x] Use appropriate data types (`Steps`, `Distance`, `SleepSession`, `ExerciseSession`, etc.)
- [x] Use `readRecords()` and `insertRecords()` methods to interact with Health Connect
- [x] Handle sync errors and cases where permissions are revoked

---

## 🛡 Privacy & Security

- [x] Add a privacy policy:
  - [x] Clearly explain what health data is collected
  - [x] Why it is collected (S.O.M.E method: Sleep, Oxygen, Move, Eat tracking)
  - [x] How it is used and stored (AES-256 encryption, HIPAA compliance)
  - [x] How users can revoke access (Health Connect settings, app settings)
- [x] Ensure data is stored securely (encrypted storage implemented)

---

## 🏪 Google Play Compliance

- [x] Complete **Data safety** section in Play Console accurately
- [x] Explain Health Connect usage clearly in-app before requesting permissions
- [x] Only request the minimum required data permissions (core: Sleep, Steps, Exercise)

---

## 📲 Testing

- [x] Test full permission request flows: granted, denied, and revoked
- [x] Test read/write logic with real fitness device data
- [x] Handle cases when Health Connect is not available or installed

---
